# Gujarati Tweet Sentiment Analysis

This is a simple Python application for performing sentiment analysis on Gujarati tweets using a Naive Bayes classifier. The project consists of two main files: `model.py`, which contains the code for training the sentiment analysis model, and `app.py`, which is a Streamlit web application for interacting with the model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Access the web application in your browser (by default, it runs on http://localhost:8501).

3. Enter a Gujarati sentence in the sidebar text area and click the "Analyze Sentiment" button to perform sentiment analysis.
