# Sentiment Analysis for Gujarati Language

This Git repository contains code and resources for sentiment analysis in the Gujarati language using various techniques and models. The repository is organized into three main folders, each dedicated to a different approach for sentiment analysis:

## 1. BERT-based Sentiment Analysis

In the `bert` folder, you'll find code and resources related to sentiment analysis using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for natural language understanding tasks, including sentiment analysis. The code in this folder is specific to sentiment analysis in Gujarati.

## 2. NLP-based Sentiment Analysis

The `nlp` folder contains code and resources for sentiment analysis using traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This approach involves techniques like tokenization, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms to classify sentiment. The code in this folder is tailored for Gujarati sentiment analysis.

## 3. Pre-trained Model-based Sentiment Analysis

In the `pre-trained-model` folder, you'll find code and resources for sentiment analysis using pre-trained models other than BERT. These models might include pre-trained machine learning models or custom-built models for Gujarati sentiment analysis.

## Dataset

Please note that both the `bert` and `nlp` folders are designed to work with the Gujarati dataset provided in this repository. Ensure that you have the dataset available and properly formatted before running the code.

## Usage

Each folder contains its own README file with detailed instructions on how to use the code and run sentiment analysis experiments. Please refer to the respective README files for guidance on getting started.
